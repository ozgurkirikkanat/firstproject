    <p>Clock Tower, which is located in Konak Square and is the symbol of Izmir, was constructed in 1901 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the reign of Sultan Abdulhamid II; 
    It was commissioned by the council consisting of the Governor of İzmir Kamil Pasha from Cyprus, Said Pasha, the Navy Major General and Eşref Pasha, the Mayor. 
    This building is 25 meters high and has four floors and an octagonal plan. Platform is made of white marble and other structures are made of cut stone. 
    The columns bear the theme of North Africa. The clock of the tower was presented by the German Emperor Wilhelm II. The outer facade of the 
    Clock Tower is made of lozenge reliefs; and 4 clocks with the diameter of 75 cm. were added. The tower was damaged in the earthquake of 5.2 magnitude in 1974 and the clock of the tower stopped at 02.04 when the earthquake occurred. Within two years the tower was repaired again and the clock still works today.</p>
